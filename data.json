            "answer": "Traditionally, landlords in Bengaluru often asked for 6-10 months' rent as a security deposit. However, the Model Tenancy Act, 2021 (MTA), which Karnataka is considering adopting, proposes capping the security deposit at a maximum of two months' rent. Current practice may still vary widely."

        {
            "question": "Are rental agreements required to be in writing?",

            "question": "Who is typically responsible for repairs in a rented property in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Generally, the landlord is responsible for major structural repairs and maintaining the property in a habitable condition.

        },
        {
            "question": "How can a landlord increase the rent in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Rent increases should ideally be governed by a clause in the rental agreement (e.g., a 5-10% increase upon renewal). If not specified, it's typically subject to negotiation between the landlord and tenant upon renewal. Arbitrary mid-term increases are generally not permissible unless agreed upon."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the process for eviction in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "A landlord cannot forcibly evict a tenant. They must have valid grounds (as potentially specified in the Karnataka Rent Act or the rental agreement, e.g., non-payment of rent, subletting without permission, misuse of property) and must typically serve a legal notice. If the tenant doesn't vacate, the landlord usually needs to file an eviction suit in the appropriate court."
        },
        {
            "question": "When should the security deposit be returned after vacating?",
            "answer": "The rental agreement usually specifies the timeline for returning the security deposit. Commonly, it's returned shortly after the tenant vacates, handover of keys, and inspection of the property for damages (beyond normal wear and tear). Any deductions should be justified."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can a tenant sublet the property in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Subletting is generally not allowed unless the rental agreement explicitly permits it or the landlord gives written consent. Unauthorized subletting can be grounds for eviction."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is tenant police verification mandatory in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Yes, landlords in Bengaluru are generally required by the city police to conduct police verification of their tenants as a security measure. Both landlord and tenant typically need to submit necessary forms and documents to the local police station."

            "question": "What is 'normal wear and tear' in the context of Indian rentals?",
            "answer": "Similar to other places, normal wear and tear refers to the natural deterioration of the property due to aging and ordinary use (e.g., paint fading, minor carpet wear). It does not include damages caused by negligence or misuse (e.g., broken windows, large stains, holes in walls)."

        {
            "question": "Does the landlord need to give notice before entering the property?",

        {
            "question": "Who pays for electricity, water, and maintenance charges?",
            "answer": "This is typically specified in the rental agreement. Usually, tenants pay for their consumption charges (electricity, water based on meter readings) and sometimes a share of society maintenance charges. Landlords usually pay property taxes."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the role of the Karnataka Rent Act?",
            "answer": "The Karnataka Rent Act, 1999, primarily governs older tenancies and specific types of properties, often providing tenants with stronger protection against eviction and rent increases. Many newer rental agreements, especially 11-month ones, may operate outside its direct purview, relying more on contract law and Transfer of Property Act principles, though its spirit might influence negotiations."
        },
        {
            "question": "What happens if the rental agreement expires and the tenant continues to stay?",
            "answer": "If the tenant stays with the landlord's consent after expiry (implied or explicit), it often becomes a month-to-month tenancy, governed by the terms of the expired agreement unless new terms are agreed upon. Both parties typically need to give notice (often one month) to terminate this arrangement."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the impact of the Model Tenancy Act, 2021 on Bengaluru rentals?",
            "answer": "The Model Tenancy Act (MTA) is a central government framework that states must adopt and adapt. While Karnataka is considering it, its direct impact depends on state-level legislation. Key proposals include capping security deposits, establishing Rent Authorities for dispute resolution, and clearly defining landlord/tenant obligations. It aims to formalize the rental market."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can a landlord cut off essential services like water or electricity?",
            "answer": "No, cutting off essential services like water or electricity supply to force a tenant out is illegal. Tenants facing this should seek legal recourse."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the primary law governing rentals in Bengaluru (Karnataka)?",
            "answer": "While the central Model Tenancy Act, 2021 exists as a guideline, rental agreements in Bengaluru are largely governed by the terms agreed upon in the rental agreement itself and provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The older Karnataka Rent Control Act, 1999 has limited applicability, mainly to older tenancies and specific building types."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is a written rental agreement mandatory in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Yes, under the framework suggested by the Model Tenancy Act (which Karnataka is encouraged to adopt), a written agreement signed by both landlord and tenant is mandatory. It should be registered with the relevant Rent Authority."
        },
        {
            "question": "What details should a rental agreement in Bengaluru include?",

        {
            "question": "What is the typical security deposit amount asked for in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Practices vary widely. While the Model Tenancy Act suggests capping deposits at two months' rent for residential properties, it's common practice in Bengaluru for landlords to ask for significantly higher amounts, often ranging from 5 to 10 months' rent."
        },
        {
            "question": "When should the security deposit be refunded?",
            "answer": "The security deposit should be refunded by the landlord when the tenant vacates the property, after deducting any agreed-upon amounts for damages (beyond normal wear and tear) or unpaid rent."
        },
        {
            "question": "Who is responsible for repairs and maintenance in a rented property in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Generally, the rental agreement specifies responsibilities. Often, landlords handle major structural repairs, while tenants manage day-to-day upkeep and minor repairs. The Model Tenancy Act provides a schedule outlining default responsibilities if not specified in the agreement."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can a landlord enter the tenant's premises anytime in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "No, tenants have a right to privacy. Landlords should provide reasonable notice (typically 24 hours as per the Model Act, unless specified otherwise or in emergencies) before entering the rented premises for inspections or repairs."
        },
        {
            "question": "How often can rent be increased in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "This is usually governed by the rental agreement. If the agreement specifies a rent review clause (e.g., a 5-10% increase annually), that applies. If not specified, under the Model Act framework, rent cannot be increased during the fixed term unless agreed upon for improvements. Landlords generally need to give notice (e.g., 3 months under the Model Act) before increasing rent."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are the legal grounds for evicting a tenant in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Common grounds include failure to pay rent for a specified period (e.g., two consecutive months), subletting without permission, misuse of the property, causing significant damage, or if the landlord requires the property for their own genuine use. These are often detailed in the rental agreement and align with principles in the Transfer of Property Act and the Model Tenancy Act."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the eviction process in India/Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "The landlord must first send a formal written 'notice to quit' specifying the reason for eviction and providing the legally required notice period (as per the agreement or Transfer of Property Act - often 15 days or one month). If the tenant doesn't vacate, the landlord must file an eviction suit in the appropriate court (Rent Court/Tribunal under the Model Act framework, or civil court)."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can a landlord cut off essential services like water or electricity to force eviction?",
            "answer": "No, this is illegal. Landlords cannot resort to 'self-help' methods. Eviction must follow the due legal process through the courts."
        },
        {
            "question": "What notice period is required to terminate a lease if not specified in the agreement?",
            "answer": "Under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, if the lease purpose isn't specified or is for 'any other purpose' (often interpreted for residential), it's deemed a month-to-month lease terminable by 15 days' notice ending with the end of a tenancy month. For agricultural/manufacturing purposes, it's deemed year-to-year, requiring 6 months' notice."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do tenants have the right to peaceful possession?",
            "answer": "Yes, tenants have the right to live in the property without undue interference or disturbance from the landlord, provided they adhere to the terms of the agreement."

            "question": "Is subletting allowed in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "Subletting is typically prohibited unless the rental agreement explicitly permits it, or the tenant obtains written consent from the landlord. The Model Act framework requires joint intimation to the Rent Authority if subletting occurs."

        {
            "question": "What can a tenant do if the landlord refuses to return the security deposit?",
            "answer": "The tenant can first send a formal demand letter.

        {
            "question": "Does the Model Tenancy Act, 2021 apply automatically in Karnataka?",
            "answer": "No, the Model Tenancy Act, 2021 is a central guideline. Each state needs to adopt and enact its own legislation based on the model act for it to be legally binding. While Karnataka has considered it, its full adoption and implementation status may vary, and existing practices/agreements often prevail."
        },
        {
            "question": "What happens if a tenant stays beyond the lease term without renewal (holding over)?",
            "answer": "If the landlord accepts rent after the lease expires, it may imply a renewal on a month-to-month basis under the previous terms. If the landlord doesn't accept rent and demands the tenant vacate, the tenant becomes a 'tenant at sufferance'. The Model Act suggests penalties (double rent for two months, then quadruple) for failing to vacate after tenancy termination."
        },
        {
            "question": "Who pays for property tax and major society maintenance charges?",
            "answer": "Usually, property tax is the landlord's responsibility. Responsibility for society maintenance charges should be clearly defined in the rental agreement; sometimes it's borne by the landlord, sometimes by the tenant, or split."
        },
        {
            "question": "Is police verification of tenants mandatory in Bengaluru?",
            "answer": "While not always strictly enforced everywhere, landlords are often advised or required by local police directives to conduct police verification of tenants, especially in major cities like Bengaluru, as a security measure. The process involves submitting tenant details to the local police station."
